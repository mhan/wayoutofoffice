                          <p>
                            During our last day in Vietnam, I was walking down
                            the street in Dong Hoi to mail some post cards
                            before heading to the airport, feeling a little sad
                            that these were my final hours in a country
                            I&rsquo;d grown to love. As I was walking by a
                            school,&nbsp;a little girl on the sidewalk asked
                            &ldquo;Where you from?&rdquo; as I approached her.
                            &ldquo;Canada!&rdquo;, I said. &ldquo;You are
                            BEE-YOO-TEE-FUL!&rdquo; she announced
                            enthusiastically, enunciating every syllable of her
                            compliment as if it were a totally normal follow up
                            to learning a person&rsquo;s nationality. I burst
                            out laughing and managed a &ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo;
                            as I continued (now merrily) on my way. How could I
                            not love this country?
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            We spent the last 3&frac12; weeks of our time in
                            Vietnam in what I think is hands-down, the
                            country&rsquo;s most magical city, Hoi An. Although
                            our apartment was simple, it was such a treat to
                            have our own kitchen, a washing machine and to not
                            have to repack our bags every few days. All the
                            things we took for granted back home have now become
                            luxuries! It was so much fun to get a taste of the
                            expat lifestyle (which many a digital nomad are
                            taking advantage of in Hoi An), and to really
                            immerse ourselves in a place for an extended period
                            of time. Having the time to do that (without an
                            ounce of guilt) feels like one of the biggest
                            advantages of a year-long trip.

                          <h2>
                            <strong>Ringing in the (Lunar) New Year</strong>
                          </h2>
                          <p>
                            One of the reasons we wanted to settle down for a
                            while in February was because travelling during the
                            lunar new year celebrations, or
                            &ldquo;T&#7871;t&rdquo; as it is called in Vietnam,
                            is a complete gong show. The entire country shuts
                            down for at least 3 days and travelling the week
                            before or after the holiday is totally insane (and
                            expensive). Watching the country prepare for
                            T&#7871;t was one of coolest experiences of our time
                            in Vietnam. It&rsquo;s like the week before
                            Christmas back home, except instead of going to the
                            mall, everyone goes to the market. And by the market
                            I mean really any kind of stall or shop that has
                            popped up on the side of the road selling flowers,
                            kumquat trees, sticky rice cakes, or other T&#7871;t
                            must-haves. Since scooters rule the streets in
                            Vietnam, a &ldquo;drive-in&rdquo; culture has
                            naturally developed where people pull up to a stall
                            on the side of the road and shout out their order
                            for sandwiches, flowers, or toilet paper without
                            ever having to get off their bike. As you can
                            imagine, this led to many a traffic jam leading up
                            to T&#7871;t as bikes crowded around the stalls,
                            consequently blocking off half the road.

                            As novice scooter drivers, these traffic jams were a
                            little stressful for us as we&rsquo;d have to
                            navigate through narrow openings the width of our
                            bike without scratching the car coming through on
                            our left or running over the toes of the lady
                            sitting on the ground selling watermelons on our
                            right. Back home, this scenario would inevitably
                            lead to some serious road rage, but in Vietnam,
                            everybody is cool as a cucumber. People are taking
                            selfies of themselves stuck in traffic because they
                            think it&rsquo;s hilarious. There are no road rules
                            to speak of (anything goes as long as you
                            communicate with your horn!) and that&rsquo;s the
                            way they like it. Their easy-going attitude makes me
                            think that maybe it&rsquo;s the overabundance of
                            rules and constraints on Western roads that leads to
                            the pent up driver frustration causing road rage in
                            the first place. Or maybe it&rsquo;s that the
                            Vietnamese are predominantly Buddhist. It could be
                            that too.

                            Like Christmas, T&#7871;t is a very family focused
                            holiday in Vietnam, which is why we were especially
                            surprised to receive an invite to an intimate family
                            dinner during T&#7871;t from the owner of the
                            apartment we rented (he might be the kindest man in
                            all of Vietnam). He doesn&rsquo;t speak any English
                            (all of our communication with him had been through
                            Google Translate) and we&rsquo;d only be living
                            there for two weeks at the time so we were pretty
                            much strangers. But in Vietnam, that doesn&rsquo;t
                            matter. Their lovely family welcomed us and some of
                            the other residents in the apartment building to
                            their table as if we were part of their family. We
                            had a delicious meal, too many beers and made some
                            new friends as we rung in the year of the dog
                            together.

                          <p>
                            The Vietnamese have a lot of traditions and
                            superstitions that go along with T&#7871;t &ndash;
                            here are a few that I found interesting:
                          </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                              The Vietnamese believe that the first person to
                              walk into your house in the new year can determine
                              the family&rsquo;s fate for the coming year.
                              Preferably it&rsquo;s someone rich and successful!
                              If that&rsquo;s unlikely to happen, the head of
                              the household will often leave the house and come
                              back in just after midnight to prevent an
                              undesirable guest being the first.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              It&rsquo;s bad luck to sweep your house or empty
                              the garbage bin during T&#7871;t as you may
                              consequently remove the good luck along with the
                              dirt and trash!
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Exchanging gifts during T&#7871;t is common. In
                              business relationships, giving someone a puppy
                              symbolizes long-term success in the partnership
                              because a dog&rsquo;s bark is thought to mimic the
                              word &ldquo;rich&rdquo; in Vietnamese (as if I
                              needed another reason to want a puppy).
                            </li>
                          </ul>

                            Maybe it&rsquo;s the communications major in me, but
                            I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot lately about social
                            media (Intsagram in particular, which is said to be
                            the most envy-inducing of the platforms) and how
                            much power I have to control how others perceive my
                            life and our trip based on what I choose to share,
                            or more importantly, not share. I could (and often
                            do!) post gorgeous pictures of beaches and our
                            smiling faces all day long and you&rsquo;d all think
                            that my life was perfect. You might even feel a
                            little jealous that you aren&rsquo;t doing what
                            we&rsquo;re doing as you shovel snow or make your
                            way into work Monday morning. Don&rsquo;t get me
                            wrong, we are indeed having the trip of a lifetime,
                            but everything is not always perfect. There are two
                            sides to every story and two versions of every
                            travel experience.

                            For example, when we visited Bai Tu Long Bay (Halong
                            Bay&rsquo;s less busy, equally beautiful neighbour)
                            for my birthday, we had a really great time for the
                            most part. We kayaked through the limestone karsts,
                            met some lovely people from Maine onboard and
                            marveled at the ridiculous dragons and swans that
                            the staff had sculpted out of vegetables!

                            We were just heading to bed congratulating ourselves
                            on what a great choice we&rsquo;d made in picking
                            Garden Bay Cruises to take us here from the hundreds
                            of tour companies we could have gone with, when we
                            heard a noise from across the room. I turned the
                            bedside lamp on on and looked around.
                          </p>
                          <p>Nothing. Lights off, eyes closed.</p>
                          <p>
                            A few moments later, we again heard a scurrying
                            sound from the next bed over that had a bunch of our
                            stuff on it. This time when I turned on the light, a
                            sizeable rat was staring right at me, perched on top
                            of Mike&rsquo;s jacket on the other bed. We locked
                            eyes in a shared moment of horror before he bolted
                            into the corner to hide. We moved everything that
                            might be of rat interest in the closet, but I knew I
                            wasn&rsquo;t going to be sleeping that night. Even
                            with the lights on, our rodent roomie continued to
                            run laps all night long from the air conditioner
                            cubby hole above the closet, down the room&rsquo;s
                            lattice decor serving as his ladder to the floor of
                            our room. I didn&rsquo;t sleep a wink that night and
                            our cruise was totally ruined. But of course,
                            you&rsquo;d never have known that if I hadn&rsquo;t
                            just told you. The whole experience (good and bad)
                            was definitely a memorable entry into my 36th year!

                          <h2><strong>Communism is complicated</strong></h2>
                          <p>
                            To be honest, I don&rsquo;t really know much about
                            communism in Vietnam besides the fact that a lot of
                            unsuccessful effort has been put into stopping it.
                            Technically Vietnam is still a communist country but
                            from what I can tell, its citizens aren&rsquo;t
                            really benefiting from any of the usual perks touted
                            by a communist regime. There is incredible disparity
                            in wealth, education (at any level) comes with a
                            price tag and old age pension is non-existent. The
                            only real signs of communism seem to be the Ho Chi
                            Minh propaganda around every corner and the corrupt
                            &lsquo;elections&rsquo; with a winner that&rsquo;s
                            been predetermined long before anybody hits the
                            polls.

                            Vietnam&rsquo;s attitude toward the government and
                            communism also seems to vary considerably from North
                            to South. Even though the country was reunited in
                            1975 when the communist North and Viet Cong forces
                            won the war, people in the South still call Ho Chi
                            Minh City by its original name, Saigon, as a symbol
                            of their ongoing defiance. Although Ho Chi Minh
                            might be a revolutionary hero in the North (to the
                            point where hysterical crying ensues when some
                            people view his mausoleum), his army isn&rsquo;t so
                            fondly remembered in the South, especially by the
                            millions who were persecuted after the war for

                            In Vietnam, there&rsquo;s no shortage of historical
                            war sites to visit as reminders of the
                            country&rsquo;s violent past are everywhere. From
                            the C&#7911; Chi Tunnels&nbsp;&ndash; an impressive
                            network of hand-dug underground of tunnels spanning
                            250km long&nbsp;&ndash; to the Hanoi Prison Museum
                            where we learned that Americans (including John
                            McCain) actually really enjoyed being incarcerated
                            there! At least, that&rsquo;s what it looked like
                            from the choice photos of their smiling faces in the

                            Even decades later, the war is still having a
                            devastating impact on the country and the
                            environment. The land and the people are still
                            suffering from the effects of agent orange, the
                            horrific chemical the Americans used to destroy the
                            thick vegetation concealing the communists.
                            Unsurprisingly, the chemical has also caused
                            terrible health problems for the people who were
                            exposed to it. Thousands of tons of unexploded
                            ordnance (UXO), especially in central Vietnam, also
                            continues to take more lives every year and has
                            killed more than 40,000 Vietnamese people since the
                            war ended. The government estimates that at least
                            15% of the country&rsquo;s total surface area is
                            contaminated by UXO, leaving vast stretches of land
                            too dangerous to use for farming, housing or
                            tourism.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a sad reminder of the
                            lasting impacts of war.

                            And yet, despite all this, you&rsquo;ll never see
                            the Vietnamese people playing the victim. They are
                            insanely hard-working and as a collective, seem
                            utterly content with what they have, even if most
                            Westerners would consider it to be very little. We
                            did an excellent food tasting tour in Hoi An and one
                            of the women leading part of it had suffered birth
                            defects as a result of agent orange. She walked with
                            a limp but was quite possibly one of the most
                            cheerful, enthusiastic people I have ever met. She
                            considered herself to be lucky because so many other
                            victims of agent orange don&rsquo;t have supportive
                            parents or access to education like she did. She now
                            devotes her time to raising money and volunteering
                            for VAVA (Vietnam Association of Victims of Agent
                            Orange) to help those less fortunate than herself.
                            I&rsquo;d been complaining a lot about the weather
                            that week. Sometimes a little dose of perspective
                            arrives just when you need it most.

                            It was good that you could spend so much time in
                            Vietnam and get to know the culture, people and
                            history so well.<br />
                            Your camera takes beautiful pictures, good eye too.
                            Looking forward to seeing you xoxoxo

                            Hi Heather,<br />
                            I wanted to tell you how very much I am enjoying
                            reading your blogs and the wonderful pictures as
                            well.<br />
                            You make me feel very much in the moment. I also
                            have a deep appreciation for the respectfulness and
                            understanding you exhibit with the different
                            cultures.<br />
                            I look forward to the next one.<br />
                            Safe travels.
