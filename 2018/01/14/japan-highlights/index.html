                          <p>
                            When I think about the three weeks we spent in
                            Japan, it&rsquo;s hard to say I got a sense of what
                            Japan is <em>really</em> like. That may in part be
                            because the three islands we visited (Okinawa,
                            Hokkaido and Honshu) are so vastly different, but
                            more likely it&rsquo;s because we just didn&rsquo;t
                            have enough time to really immerse ourselves in the
                            culture when we were moving around ever 3 or 4 days.
                            I could write about what we did, what we saw, and
                            what we ate in Japan (most of which were wonderful),
                            but in my opinion, that would make for a pretty
                            boring blog post. I&rsquo;ll spare you that agony!

                            One realization (or rather confirmation) that did
                            come out of our Japan itinerary is our decided
                            preference for slow (rather than fast) travel. While
                            we were planning out our trip, we listened to a lot
                            of travel podcasts and one episode in particular
                            about slow vs. fast travel sparked a discussion
                            between Mike and I about how we wanted shape our
                            itinerary. Would we embrace fast travel and try to
                            accomplish as much as possible during our year off?
                            Or would we take it slow and use this opportunity to
                            spend more time in places than we would normally be
                            able to with a limited number of vacation days?
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            I&rsquo;d say we landed somewhere in the middle.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Initially we&rsquo;d planned to take it real slow
                            and spend two months in each country. But as our
                            destination wish list grew longer and longer, it was
                            too hard to narrow it down to only six countries.
                            Plus, some places (like Japan) were just too
                            expensive to spend that much time in. In the end, we
                            came up with an itinerary that included the
                            experiences that were most important to each of us,
                            while still allowing for some unplanned adventures
                            and extended time in cheaper destinations so we
                            could really immerse ourselves in countries like
                            Vietnam.

                            I think Mike and I suspected we were slow travellers
                            all along. Most of our past vacations were spent
                            sleeping in and lackadaisically semi-planning out
                            the day&rsquo;s activities over a mid-morning cup of
                            coffee &ndash; but we often chalked that up to the
                            fact that we wanted our vacations to be a relaxing
                            break from our hectic work life. The more we travel,
                            however, the more obvious it&rsquo;s become that
                            waking up at the crack of dawn and packing each day
                            with a checklist of sights and activities just
                            isn&rsquo;t our style. If we&rsquo;re setting an
                            alarm clock on this trip, it better be for a damn
                            good reason!

                            Sometimes slow travel isn&rsquo;t that sexy. I
                            remember returning from our European vacation a
                            while back and trying to explain to a coworker why
                            I&rsquo;d loved Berlin so much. When I&rsquo;d
                            finished he said &ldquo;Hmmm, ya, I don&rsquo;t
                            think I&rsquo;m ever going to Berlin!&rdquo;. I felt
                            bad that I couldn&rsquo;t do it justice. I
                            couldn&rsquo;t provide a long list of sights
                            we&rsquo;d seen, or tours we did, or clubs
                            we&rsquo;d partied at. Instead we just wandered
                            around neighbourhoods and stumbled upon picturesque
                            beer gardens, al fresco cafes and community
                            festivals. It was perfect.

                            Sure, maybe fast travel gives you better Instagram
                            fodder, or more stories to tell upon your return,
                            but there&rsquo;s no way we could keep up the that
                            pace for a whole year. It would be exhausting and
                            not much fun &ndash; at least for us! So four months
                            into our journey, we&rsquo;re looking for a place we
                            can settle down for a few weeks in Vietnam to rest
                            up, work on some projects, and pretend to be locals.
                            Having the time and freedom to do that feels truly
                            luxurious.

                          <p>
                            All that said, we did have a great time in Japan and
                            enjoyed some incredible experiences during our three
                            weeks of (relatively) fast travel. Here are some of
                            the highlights.

                          <h2><strong>Okinawa</strong></h2>
                          <p>
                            A lot of people who visit this island South of Japan
                            say it feels like a completely different country
                            than the rest of Japan. I&rsquo;d have to agree. Two
                            of Mike&rsquo;s classmates were from Okinawa (aka
                            the &ldquo;Okie&rdquo; girls) so he asked them what
                            the most famous dishes were from the island that we
                            should make sure to try while we were there. He
                            expected them to respond with some type of exotic
                            fish or seafood dish, but instead they said to try
                            Taco Rice! It&rsquo;s pretty much exactly what it
                            sounds like: A really generic Tex-Mex taco filling
                            served on top of white rice. The dish is an
                            indication of America&rsquo;s influence on the
                            island and a pretty good representation of its
                            inhabitants, at least in Naha, Okinawa&rsquo;s
                            biggest city. The Americans have had a strong
                            military presence there since the end of WWII so
                            there&rsquo;s an odd mix of Korean tourists and
                            beefy US army dudes walking the streets.

                          <p>
                            Most people have never heard of Okinawa, but this
                            small island has a tragic history. During WWII,
                            Okinawa lost one third of its population, over
                            150,000 people (mostly civilians). If you&rsquo;ve
                            seen the movie Hacksaw Ridge, it features the Battle
                            of Okinawa &ndash; the last and one of the bloodiest
                            of the war. We didn&rsquo;t have an International
                            Drivers License (a bit of an oversight on our part)
                            so couldn&rsquo;t rent a car to see the historical
                            or natural sights on the island, but it was still
                            worth a visit.

                          <h2><strong>Niseko</strong></h2>
                          <p>
                            At least for me, hitting the slopes in Niseko was my
                            #1 motivation for adding Japan to our itinerary and
                            was the highlight of our time there. I&rsquo;d heard
                            about Hokkaido&rsquo;s legendary
                            &ldquo;JapPow&rdquo; and man, did it ever deliver!
                            Conditions were unusually good for December and
                            I&rsquo;m pretty sure I had a non-stop grin on my
                            face all day long as I weaved in and out of the
                            knee-deep, feather-light snow. At the end of each
                            run, I&rsquo;d have powder sprayed up to my belly
                            button to the point where Mike started
                            affectionately referring to me as
                            &ldquo;Snowcrotch&rdquo;. I took it as a compliment.
                            We soothed our aching muscles at the onsen (Japanese
                            hotspring) each night as I officially came to terms
                            with my naked public bathing fears. They do provide
                            what they call a &ldquo;modesty towel&rdquo; about
                            the size of a legal sheet of paper to help hide your
                            bits, but I think chugging a beer from the Sapporo
                            vending machine in the onsen lobby might be a better
                            strategy for nervous nudies.

                            We knew there was a volcano (Mt. Yotei) near Niseko,
                            but with the non-stop blizzard the first two days we
                            were there, we had no idea where it was. The
                            forecast for the following day was calling for clear
                            skies and I actually uttered the now hilarious
                            statement, &ldquo;I wonder if we&rsquo;ll be able to
                            see Yotei from the slopes?&rdquo;. When the clouds
                            parted, you really couldn&rsquo;t miss her!

                            People stay for weeks in Niseko and never see the
                            volcano so we were incredibly lucky to get both a
                            powder day and a bluebird afternoon consecutively.
                            Despite it being totally overrun with Aussies like
                            every ski resort in Canada (or the world?!), it was
                            hard to leave magical Niseko. But after a bowl of
                            the region&rsquo;s famous potato ramen, we hopped on
                            the train back to Sapporo and eased our powder
                            withdrawal with a few generous whiskey tastings at
                            the Nikka distillery en route!

                          <h2><strong>Kyoto</strong></h2>
                          <p>
                            Mid-way though the two hour train journey from the
                            Osaka airport, I started to wonder if visiting Kyoto
                            was really worthwhile. It was. This picturesque city
                            is pretty much one big outdoor museum with temples,
                            castles and shrines around every corner. You
                            don&rsquo;t even really have to try to see
                            historical sights because you just stumble on them
                            as you&rsquo;re walking around &ndash; perfect for
                            us slow travellers! We stayed in an area of the city
                            called Gion which is the historical entertainment
                            district. I didn&rsquo;t realize until we arrived
                            that the entertainment was of the female variety!
                            There were &ldquo;girls bars&rdquo; everywhere and
                            tourists running around with their cameras trying to
                            spot a <em>geisha</em> (not actually a Japanese
                            prostitute, contrary to popular belief) rushing to
                            her next appointment.

                            It&rsquo;s insane to think that none of
                            Kyoto&rsquo;s historical charm would have been
                            available to us if it had been completely flattened
                            by an atomic bomb in WWII. The city was on the
                            shortlist of possible targets, but many historians
                            believe it was removed at the insistence of the US
                            Secretary of War who had honeymooned in Kyoto and
                            had a sentimental attachment to it. It&rsquo;s also
                            insane to think that something as trivial as a
                            person&rsquo;s honeymoon destination could determine
                            the fate of an entire city and tens of thousands of
                            lives.

                            Perhaps it was learning that tidibit of information
                            that made me appreciate it more, or that I&rsquo;m a
                            fan of any place that has dedicated parking lots for
                            cyclists (or maybe it was that we saw Star Wars: The
                            Last Jedi in Imax while we were there?), but there
                            was something special about Kyoto that I won&rsquo;t
                            forget.

                          <p>
                            One thing that became obvious as we travelled
                            through Japan was that my preconceived ideas about
                            what Japanese people are like was for the most part,
                            completely incorrect. I started to wonder where
                            these stereotypes had come from when I&rsquo;d never
                            read any books about Japan or done any kind of
                            diligent research that would entitle me to even
                            begin forming an opinion about what common traits
                            this nation&rsquo;s people might share.

                            Here are some things I&rsquo;d heard about Japan
                            before we visited:
                          </p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Japanese people are polite and quiet</li>
                            <li>
                              Japan&rsquo;s marriage and fertility rates have
                              been declining in recent years
                            </li>
                            <li>
                              Japan has one of the highest suicide rates of
                              developed countries
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                          <p>&nbsp;</p>
                          <div class="mceTemp"></div>
                          <p>
                            That first bullet on the list seems pretty accurate.
                            From what I experienced, Japanese people are very
                            polite and mild-mannered. But for some reason
                            (because of conversations I&rsquo;ve had with other
                            people, or my brain&rsquo;s weird inclination to
                            jump to conclusions), I started to assume those
                            character traits were the cause of bullet points two
                            and three as well. If Japanese people aren&rsquo;t
                            getting married, it must be because they are too shy
                            and quiet to interact with potential partners. And
                            because they&rsquo;re not getting married, they are
                            lonely, depressed and suicidal.
                          </p>
                          <p><em>What?! Where did that come from?</em></p>
                          <p>
                            I&rsquo;m embarrassed to even write that down
                            because it sounds so ridiculous. In reality,
                            Japan&rsquo;s low marriage and high suicide rates
                            can be attributed much more to economics than
                            personality traits. Unemployment (and the stigma
                            around unemployment) is a big cause of depression in
                            Japan, and it also turns out that unemployed men (or
                            even part-time workers) aren&rsquo;t meeting the
                            criteria that Japanese women are looking for in a
                            life partner. That&rsquo;s a total
                            oversimplification of course, and there are many
                            other reasons, but none of them have to do with
                            Japanese people being too shy to date.

                          <p>
                            I wonder how long I would have continued to let
                            those assumptions build in my mind if I hadn&rsquo;t
                            visited Japan and started to ask more questions
                            about what was going on there? To me, that&rsquo;s
                            one of the greatest benefits of travel. When you get
                            out of your living room (and your head!) and
                            interact with real people in the places you&rsquo;ve
                            heard about, you get curious. You&rsquo;re forced to
                            compare the stereotypes you might not even realize
                            you&rsquo;re carrying, with the reality that&rsquo;s
                            there in front of you. Maybe I didn&rsquo;t get a
                            complete understanding of Japan during my time
                            there, but I certainly know more now than I did
                            before.

                            Such a great post! LOL at the toilet usage
                            instructions and your public bath experience &ndash;
                            you&rsquo;re braver than me, I think I would need to
                            use the Modesty Towel (although your beer-based
                            modesty protip is a good one).
